===========

A peer-to-peer, interest based social network with an integrated CRM using the WebRTC data channel.  We are actively seeking a volunteer developer to help us take the first step towards a working prototype. This project currently exists as a collaborative brainstorming document on Google Drive, and a small community on Google+ where many of the issues were fleshed out further.  Functional specifications have been written and will be uploaded here sortly  That community has not been active and will be closed, and this GitHub site will take over that function.
